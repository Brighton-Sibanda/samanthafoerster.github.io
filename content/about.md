## Neuroscience + Music

I am a pre-med undergraduate at Northwestern University. My experience includes:

- Researching neurogenetics, Alzheimer’s, and microbiomes in space.
- Working with DOD and NASA-funded projects.
- Observing clinical practices at the Mayo Clinic ICU.

Outside the lab, I lead a local band as a vocalist. I’m passionate about combining science and creativity.
